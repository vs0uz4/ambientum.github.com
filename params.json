On the last years, our buddy Docker has becoming more and more mature and now it's becoming the standard.\r\n\r\nWe all love Laravel, but why develop a rockstar code with a kickass framework without a awesome environment? no more \"it worked on my machine\"!\r\n\r\n### TL;DR\r\nIf you're something like me, you don't have all the patience of reading documentations fully, so here are the supported images and they matching docker-compose entries. Although We highly recommend you to read the whole thing.\r\n\r\n> We expect to release a config generator supporting both docker-compose, docker cloud (formerly Tutum) and Rancher real soon.\r\n\r\n|Repository            | Images/Tags         | Description                                                          |\r\n|----------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| ambientum/redis      | `3.0`               | Redis Server v3.0                                                    |\r\n|                      | `3.2`               | Redis Server v3.2                                                    |\r\n|                      | `latest`            | Redis Server Latest version (alias of 3.2)                           |\r\n| ambientum/mysql      | `5.5`               | MySQL Server v5.5                                                    |\r\n|                      | `5.6`               | MySQL Server v5.6                                                    |\r\n|                      | `5.7`               | MySQL Server v5.7 (with sql-mode='')                                 |\r\n|                      | `5.7`               | MySQL Server Latest version (alias of 5.7)                           |\r\n| ambientum/php        | `7.0`               | PHP v7.0 for command line and queues                                 |\r\n|                      | `latest`            | PHP Latest version for command line and queues (alias of 7.0)        |\r\n",
